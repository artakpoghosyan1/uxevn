                    <a href="http://uxevn.com" target="_blank" class="link link--purple font-primary--bold">UXEVN</a> started in 2015 with an Armenian designer on a mission to create an outstanding Armenian platform for UX designers. By uniting the local and foreign designers, UXEVN aims to develop the Armenian UX community. Throughout the years, we have organized 2 amazing conferences, where Vitaly Friedman from Smashing Magazine, Alberta Soranzo from Lloyds Banking Group, and Nick Babich from UX Planet participated. Aside from the conferences, we had 10 interactive meetups. Due to the Covid-19 situation, we switched to the online platform and conducted 4 online talks. The results are very promising, and we are planning to have more sessions.

                    Presented by the UXEVN community, <strong>Design2Science</strong> is going to launch on October 22, 2020. Even though the event is in its first year, we believe that it will have an annual occurrence. We guarantee two enlightening and exciting days by bringing together international experts who will cover a great range of topics and ideas relevant to professionals and other interested enthusiasts. We also have hands-on workshops, where you will learn new techniques, methods, and practical skills that can help you improve your abilities. We are sure that Design2Science will provide you the knowledge needed to think outside of the box, stretch your mind, boost your imagination and creativity. Join us from the comfort of your home and get the inspiration to become the next best evangelizer and conqueror of the design world.
