                                    “Are you ready for a design challenge? In this series of online workshops, Vitaly Friedman, creative lead and front-end/UI designer behind Smashing Magazine, will be taking a microscopic examination of common components and design patterns in modern interfaces — on desktop and on mobile.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We’ll study 100s of hand-picked examples and we’ll be designing interfaces together, starting from accordions, to mega-drop-downs, sliders, feature comparisons, car configurators — all the way to timelines and onboarding. And: We’ll be reviewing and providing feedback to each other’s work.
                                </p>

                                    Who is this workshop for? This workshop is for interface designers, front-end designers and developers who’d love to be prepared for complex and time-consuming design challenges.

                                    You'll need to bring a lot of creativity with your preferred coffee mug. We’ll be spending a lot of time drawing, sketching, designing and thinking. Be ready to challenge your general view of design process and how our interface should look like. Laptop is useeful but not really necessary. You’ll need a lot of sleep reserves since it’s going to be a packed session. Bring a lot of attention to detail and non-standard thinking to this one! ;-)
